# Analog Clock
## 📝 Description
This is a website which features an analog clock, whichs ticks in realtime. It may help with organizing your day or with learning, since you may want to keep this website open to check how much you've already learned.
## What was used to build the analog clock?
To build the analog clock I used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

To build the analog clock I used a pre-made HTML-file and CSS. In CSS I used the help of the classes in HTML to create all the pieces that I needed for the clock. That includes the hour marking, the hands for seconds, minutes and hours and the outer and inner clock faces. To make the clock function in realtime, I used JavaScript. I used it to make the hands of the clock rotate and update them based off of the current time.
